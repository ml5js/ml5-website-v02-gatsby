It's Okay to Let Go

Wanyu Chen
NYU Shanghai IMA

It's Okay to Let Go is an interactive ml.js project that presents a juxtaposed visual of arms and hands and explores the theme of imperfection. Using hand-tracking interactions of grabbing and releasing, which respectively symbolize the pursuit of everything versus the imperfect act of letting go, the work aims to evoke a feeling that is both peculiar and healing.

How AI Is Used in This Project
I used ml.js to realize hand-tracking interactions of grabbing and releasing.

Interactivity
The project interacts with a user's hand gestures through a camera-based ml.js hand-tracking programme. The justaposition features the arms animation on the left and real-time camera capturing of audience's hands on the right. When the user's make a grabbing gesture, the arms would transform into sea anemone-like structures, creating a “swallowing” sensation to convey greed and tension. Particles would converge chaotically toward the user’s palms. When the audience make a releasing gesture, the arms would start  throw particles away like fireworks. The particles would radiate outwards from the user's palm, and butterflies are generated and fly away from their fingertips. When there is no hands detected, the scene would return to calm with arms swaying gently.
