Description:
The Music Looper is a web-based interactive application built with p5.js and ml5.js that lets users create music using hand gestures. Users can layer and loop sounds from instruments like guitar, piano, drums, and violin, with each instrument offering a unique gesture-based interaction method. The project explores the intersection of creative coding, music, and human-computer interaction, allowing anyone to experiment with rhythm, melody, and harmony in an intuitive and playful way.
